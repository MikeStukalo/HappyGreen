# HappyGreen
This is a project for the Harvard Extension School class on Wearable devices.

The goal is to develop a prototype of a device and software that will predict the result of a golf putt. 

The putts were recorded and tested using an indoor putt green.

## Structure of the repo

\ Code - a folder with all software related code

\Code\1_DataCollect - script for collection of the raw data
\Code\1_DataCollect\data - collected data, response variable, and exaggerated swing data for axes alignment

\Code\2_FeatureExtraction - iPython notebooks for putt detection and feature extraction
\Code\2_FeatureExtraction\data - cleaned dataset of putts, test and train datasets pickled

\Code\3_Modelling - iPython notebooks with CatBoost model training and training results
\Code\3_Modelling\data - trained model

\Code\4_Implementation - python scripts that implement the prototype of the app
\Code\4_Implementation\data - trained model, .csv files used to debug the script

\Presentation - project report presentation

\Report - project report (.doc and .pdf)
